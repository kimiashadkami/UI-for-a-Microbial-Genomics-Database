# UI-for-a-Microbial-Genomics-Database
A Web-based User Interface for a Microbial Genomics Database / Undergraduate Honours Project Supervised by Dr. Olivier Tremblay-Savard

## Motivation
Aaron Petkau, a Master’s Student in the Bioinformatics Lab at the University of Manitoba, is currently focused on building a framework to pre-process microbial genomes at different levels of resolution and store these processed genomes within a database for later comparisons. The framework provides support for searching for closely related microbial genomes or genomes containing specific genomic features (mutations or genes). This will provide an all-in-one tool for biologists, epidemiologists, and other researchers who are interested in using genomics for infectious disease investigations.

However, this framework is primarily being developed with a command-line interface, which limits the user base to those particularly skilled with command-line tools.

## Background

The use of microbial whole-genome sequencing is now routinely used to study and track infectious diseases worldwide. A topical example would be the use of sequenced genomes of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to track the spread of COVID-19 [1], but genome sequencing is also used to investigate outbreaks of food-borne illnesses caused by bacteria such as Salmonella enterica or Escherechi coli [2]. Microbial whole-genome sequencing is a process where the genetic code of a microorganism (e.g., a bacteria or virus) is read by a specialized machine and stored as data on a computer. Collections of microbial genomes can provide a wealth of information to aid in infectious disease investigations. A common analysis method is to compare collections of genomes at differing levels of resolution (e.g., mutations or genes) to infer how diseases are transmitted across a population or for tracking more severe forms of the disease based on differences in the underlying genetic code [3].

## Problem statement

Since the framework is being developed with a command-line interface so far, having a web interface could broaden its user base. A web interface could be used for summarizing data within this system and provide the capability for users to search for information of interest and review or download relevant results. We propose as an Honours Project to build such a web interface. We believe this will increase the exposure of the database software to a much wider audience.

## Facilities
In this project, the help and guidance of Dr. Tremblay-Savard, Aaron Petkau, and members of the Bioinformatics Lab at the University of Manitoba who are well-informed about different topics in computer science will enhance our overall experience and the quality of our deliverables. We will be using the Bioinformatics Discord channel for communication with other members of the lab.

## Deliverables
Our deliverable is the web interface for Aaron Petkau’s Master’s project. This includes the following:
a.	Support for searching for closely related microbial genomes.
b.	Support for searching for genomes containing particular features (mutations genes) of interest.
c.	A display of summary or statistics of data stored within the database and other interesting visualizations.
